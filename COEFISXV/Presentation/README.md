## Examples

* DistanceAction.mp4
* MagneticFieldScene.mp4
* NewtonCriticScene.mp4
* QuantumMechanics.mp4
* RetardedPotential.mp4
* SRScene.mp4

## Usage

To run any of the examples, you will need to have [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) installed on your system. Once you have Manim installed, navigate to the directory for the example you want to run and execute the following command:

```sh
manim Presentation.py
```

This will render the scene and save the output video to an mp4 file in the same directory.
