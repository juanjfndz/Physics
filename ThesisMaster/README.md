# Master's Thesis on Bosonic Field Theories

## Abstract
The present thesis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of bosonic field theories, focusing on developing essential skills in constructing such theories. Through exploring this topic, we aim to deepen our understanding of the current state of knowledge in the field and contribute significantly to our understanding of fundamental interactions.

The thesis structure is divided into several chapters. It begins with three key concepts for the analysis of the theories presented in subsequent chapters: the Ostrogradsky theorem, Wigner classification, and Hodge dual. The study then considers spin-1, spin-2, and Kalb-Ramond fields in their massive and massless forms. A methodology for analyzing physical theories is presented, focusing on the degrees of freedom of associated fields, examining both physical and apparent degrees of freedom, deriving the equation of motion, and studying the Hamiltonian of the theory to verify that it is free of Ostrogradsky instabilities. The behavior of the spin of each component of the massless fields is also analyzed.

In summary, this thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of bosonic field theories, aiming to deepen our understanding of the current state of knowledge in the field and make significant contributions to our understanding of fundamental interactions.

**Keywords**: Bosonic field theories, Degrees of Freedom, Spin-1 field, Spin-2 field, Kalb-Ramond field.
